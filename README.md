# hal900_Bot

This project is in reality an excercise in DOM structure and Bot creation with HTML editing using JS.
The bot is styled as Hall 9000 from 2001. 

The simple bot will reply to the users input and provide answers accordingly.

This may be further developed in the future, but the simple nature of the code has it's limitations.
